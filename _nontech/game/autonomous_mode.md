title: Autonomous Mode
---

**Autonomous mode** refers to the period in the match where the [robot](robot) operates without any user input. It began in the 2003 game [Stack Attack](stack-attack), primarily as a means to make the [programming](programming) aspect of FIRST more exciting and challenging. The autonomous mode persisted in 2004 [FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar](first-frenzy), and has continued ever since.

In 2003, the main options for autonomous mode included [line following](line-following) and [dead reckoning](dead-reckoning). In 2004, while these were still viable options, the addition of an [IR beacon](IR_beacon "IR beacon") and [IR sensor](IR_sensor "IR sensor") added the ability to hone into the beacon to complete the task of knocking down the "10 point ball." The 2003 game manual describes autonomous mode like this:

> As soon as the game starts, all robots will be under autonomous control (no human drivers) for a period of 15 seconds. During this time, the robots will operate and react only to sensor inputs and to commands programmed by their teams into the onboard robot control system. Operator control of the robot will not be possible during this time. (see [2003 Game Manual](http://www2.usfirst.org/2003comp/The_Game.pdf "http://www2.usfirst.org/2003comp/The_Game.pdf" ))
