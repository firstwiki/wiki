{% include historical %}

The 2003 [Robot Controller](robot-controller)
is basically the same as the [2000 RC](Robot_Controller_%282000%29
"Robot Controller \(2000\)" ) except that it added support for [Autonomous
mode](autonomous-mode).

It uses the [BS2sx](BS2sx "BS2sx" ) microcontroller, as does the
[Robovation (2003)](robovation).
