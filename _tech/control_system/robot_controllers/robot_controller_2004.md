{% include historical %}

The FIRST [Robot Controller](robot-controller)
is the required onboard computer that controls robots. It can be
programmed in C using the [MCC18](MCC18 "MCC18" ) compiler. The RC
has a corresponding [Operator Interface](operator-interface) (OI) that takes inputs and transmits them via a 900mhz
radio to the FRC. The FRC is similar in design and use to the [2004
Robovation](robovation). This RC
includes a [TTL port](TTL_port).

Note that in previous years, the RC was very different.

## Changes in 2005

The 2005 robot controller is identical to the 2004 one, except that:

  * It has two pins for the backup battery instead of the socket 
  * It comes with version 10 of the [firmware](firmware). 

## Changes in 2006

The primary change in
[2006](robot-controller-2006) was changing the processor from PIC18F8520 to a
PIC18F8722.
