#### Product Overview:
This electronic module is produced by Cross the Road Electronics. 

The Talon is the latest generation in Brushed DC motor control. The Talon features locked anti-phase rectification that provides more efficient delivery of power to Brushed DC motors. This type of rectification returns current to the power source during the freewheeling period of the motor and during direction change. The passive cooling design reduces the number of entry points for damage causing conductive debris. Any Debris that does enter the housing won't get past the conformal coating that protects the surface mount components.

#### Product Overview:
The AS5145 is a contact-less magnetic rotary encoder for accurate angular measurement over a full turn of 360 degrees. It is a system-on-chip, combining integrated Hall elements, analog front end and digital signal processing in a single device. To measure the angle, only a simple 2-pole magnet, rotating over the center of the chip, is required. The magnet may be placed above or below the IC. The absolute angle measurement provides instant indication of the magnet's angular position with a resolution of 0.0879 degrees = 4096 positions per revolution. This digital data is available as a serial bit stream and as a PWM signal. An internal voltage regulator allows the AS5145 to operate at either 3.3V or 5V supplies.
#### Specifications:
- Contact-less high resolution rotational position encoding over a full turn of 360 degrees
- 2 digital 12-bit absolute outputs: Serial interface and Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) outputs
- 3 incremental outputs 12 bit pre-programmed incremental mode
- User programmable zero position
- Failure detection mode for magnet placement monitoring and loss of power supply
- "Red-Yellow-Green" indicators display placement of magnet in Z-axis
- Serial read-out of multiple interconnected AS5145 devices using Daisy Chain mode
- Tolerant to magnet misalignment and air gap variations
- Wide temperature range: -40 degrees C to +150 degrees C
- Fully automotive AEC-Q100 qualified

#### Product Overview:
This sensor board includes a digital accelerometer and an analog gyroscope. The two boards are connected, but can be split apart by the user, if needed. Analog Devices sensors (ADXL345 and ADW22307) are used on the boards.

The sensors work well, even while still connected. During many applications, users use one sensor to back up the other. For example, the accelerometer is good at determining absolute angle, but not so good at this when the robot is
moving. Also, the gyroscope is good at determining angular rate of change, but not good at finding an absolute angle.
#### Individual use:
During some applications, the user may need to split apart these two sensors. Before you separate these two boards, make sure you follow proper ESD procedures so the boards aren’t zapped. To do this, gently flex the board but don’t “snap” it, as damage to the surface mounted components can occur. Carefully increase your flexing force until you can feel and hear the circuit board fibers giving way. The board will eventually split, when it will easily bend in half. The raw edges will be rough, but can be smoothed out by rubbing a metal edge over them.
#### Specifications for the Digital Accelerometer:
The 3-axis accelerometer using Analog Devices part number ADXL345 measures dynamic acceleration (vibration) and static acceleration (gravity). Please handle this sensor with care, as it is sensitive.

Mounting: Clearance holes for a #4 screw are present on the board. We recommend plastic screws for electrically isolating the board from a metal mounting plate. Also, it may be wise to use a shock-absorbing pad or grommet to isolate signalsto the board.

Communication: This sensor can communicate with a control system using the Digital Sidecar digitally by either of two protocols:
- SPI: This is on J4 and can be wired to the Digital I/O on the Digital Sidecar. Although the pins can be connected to any GPIOs in any order, it is easiest to use Digital I/O 1-4. Connect 0V and 5V to the (-) and PWR pins that are just beyond Digital I/O 1, and [CK, DI, DO, CS] in order.
- I2C: This port is on J2 and can be wired to the pins on the Digital Sidecar found directly behind the NXT connector. Connect 5V to 5V, SCL to SCL, SDA to SDA, and (-) to 0V. By default, the I2C address is 0x3A. The address can be set to 0xA6 by shorting J1 with a blob of solder.

Two optional interrupt pins, I1 and I2, are found at the end of the SPI connector but can be used with either I2C or SPI. These pins can be set to alert if the ADXL345 detects a tap (bump) or a fall, or they may be used for some of the advanced flow control functions. Connect one or both of them to any of the Digital I/O on the Digital Sidecar to use these functions.

The Analog Devices website has operation instructions and code examples, useful once the ADXL345 is wire up. Check out http://www.analog.com/ for more information.

Note: The ADXL345 starts in a power saving mode. You must turn it on by writing 0x08 to POWER_CTL (0x2D) before it will do anything interesting.
#### Yaw Rate Gyro:
The angular rate sensor (gyroscope) using Analog Devices part number ADW22307 detects angular changes about the board’s top surface axis. The output is a voltage proportional to the angular rate change. The user can read this information for guidance, stability, and control of the robot platform. The most accurate reading from this gyro will take place if it is mounted flat in or near the center axis of the robots rotation.

Mounting: Clearance holes for a #4 screw are present on the board. We recommend plastic screws for electrically isolating the board from a metal mounting plate. Also, it may be wise to use a shock-absorbing pad or grommet to isolate signals to the board.

Usage: The ADW22307 can measure up to 250°/s of rotation. Nominal output is 2.5V at standstill, plus 7mV/°/s. The carrier board adds a double pole low-pass filter set to 400Hz. Users can experiment with digital filters in order to select a bandwidth appropriate for their specific usage.

The ADW22307 has an integrated temperature sensor to assist in temperature compensation. Nominal output is 2.5V at 25°C plus 9mV/°C.

#### Product Overview:
Shaft collars are one of the most versatile machine components and have a variety of uses such as positioning, guiding, stopping, clamping, and spacing. They are single point faced (indicated by a circular groove on the face) during the boring operation to ensure face to bore perpendicularity. This is important for alignment when a shaft collar is used as a load bearing face, mechanical stop, or for mounting components such as gears or bearings. 

Two-piece shaft collars offer all the benefits of one-piece shaft collars with additional versatility, convenience, and holding power. The split design is easily installed and disassembled saving time when adjustment, removal, or replacement is necessary. Two-piece shaft collars use the full seating torque of its forged screws to apply a uniform distribution of forces around the shaft's circumference. These clamping forces provide the collar with a holding power superior to one-piece and set screw shaft collars. Two-piece shaft collars are also more adaptable to shafts which vary a small amount from nominal size.

#### Product Overview:
Beam couplings are an economical choice with good all around performance characteristics. They are machined from a single piece of aluminum and feature multiple spiral cuts. This multiple cut design provides higher torque capabilities and greatly reduces wind-up when compared to single beam type couplings.

#### Product Overview:
Beam couplings are an economical choice with good all around performance characteristics. They are machined from a single piece of aluminum and feature multiple spiral cuts. This multiple cut design provides higher torque capabilities and greatly reduces wind-up when compared to single beam type couplings.

Four beam couplings are designed for precision applications that use delicate components such as encoders or tachometers. They provide extra flexibility to yield reduced bearing loads when within coupling specifications.

#### Product Overview:
Zero backlash jaw couplings are a three piece assembly comprised of two aluminum hubs and one elastomer element called “the spider.” Made of an advanced polyurethane material, the spider provides dampening of impulse loads, minimizing shock to the motor and other sensitive equipment.

Jaw couplings hubs press fit onto the spider, assuring zero backlash operation. The curved jaw profile concentrates the forces to the center of the spider’s limbs, improving the effectiveness of the elastomer material. Raised contact points on the spider limbs help maintain proper spacing between the two hubs, assuring electrical isolation and full angular misalignment capabilities. Jaw couplings are considered fail safe because if the spider fails, the jaws of the two hubs interlock for direct power transmission, allowing the application to be safely shut down.
#### Ordering Requirements:
You must order two hubs and one spider to make a complete coupling. For example, a 3/8” to 1/4" coupling with a 92 Shore A spider should be ordered as follows: JC16-6-A (fc13-081), JC16-4-A (fc13-080), and JD16/25-92Y (fc13-083).
#### Specifications:
Part Number: JC16-4-A
Bore, B (in): 0.250
Outside Diameter, OD (in): 1
Coupling Length, L (in): 1.390
Hub Length, LH (in): 0.467
Shaft Penetration (in): 0.467
Clamp Screw (in): M3
