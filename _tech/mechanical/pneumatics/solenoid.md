A **solenoid** is a [pneumatics](pneumatics)
component that allows electronic control of air pressure flow.

## Connections


### Input

All solenoids have one input. This should come directly from a [pressure
regulator](pressure-regulator). Uses either a
quick connect connector or is threaded for a 1/8" brass fitting.


### Output

Solenoids have two outputs, they go to each end of a
[cylinder](pneumatic-cylinder). Uses either a quick connect (1/4"
OD) connector or is threaded for a 1/8" NPT brass fitting.


### Electrical input

Solenoids usually have a wire leads or a proprietary connector. They are
connected to a [spike](spike-relay) for controlling.


## Types


### Single Solenoid

Single solenoids apply pressure to one end of the
[cylinder](pneumatic-cylinder) until a voltage is applied to the
signal input, then the pressure is applied to the other end.


### Double Solenoid

Double solenoids are similar to a single solenoid except pressure is only
applied when a signal is received. When a signal is not sent to either end,
pressure is applied to neither end, and the [cylinder](pneumatic-cylinder)
holds its position.
